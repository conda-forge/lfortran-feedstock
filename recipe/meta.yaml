  summary: Modern interactive LLVM-based Fortran compiler
  description: |
    LFortran is a modern open-source (BSD licensed) interactive Fortran
    compiler built on top of LLVM. It can execute user's code interactively to
    allow exploratory work (much like Python, MATLAB or Julia) as well as
    compile to binaries with the goal to run userâ€™s code on modern
    architectures such as multi-core CPUs and GPUs.
